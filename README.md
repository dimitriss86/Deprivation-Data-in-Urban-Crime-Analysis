# Principles of Data Science Coursework

## Overview
This repository hosts my coursework for the Principles of Data Science class. It focuses on analyzing crime data from the Metropolitan Police for London, merged with the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) Data for 2019. The goal is to explore correlations between crime rates and various types of deprivation, enhancing our understanding of socio-economic impacts on crime.

## Project Details
- **Data Pre-processing**: Integration and transformation of crime data with IMD scores to facilitate deeper analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilizing statistical and visual tools to uncover underlying patterns and insights in the crime data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating the relationships between different crime types and deprivation indicators.

## Key Insights
- Identification of crime hotspots and their socio-economic contexts.
- Analysis of the most common crime types and their distribution across different levels of deprivation.
- Exploration of potential factors influencing crime rates, including income, employment, and educational opportunities.
